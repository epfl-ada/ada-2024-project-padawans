# Abstract 
Movie recommendation algorithms typically rely on users' viewing histories to suggest similar content using a method called Content-Based Filtering. Similarity is often defined through genres, shared directors, or box-office earnings. This project, however, focuses on leveraging movie synopses to assess similarity, employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for unsupervised clustering. LDA is used to uncover 15 hidden themes within movie synopses that go beyond traditional genres, revealing deeper patterns in the content. By analyzing these themes, we aim to identify unique connections between films, with additional consideration of language and country of origin, to enable more enhanced and diversified movie recommendations.

# Example Instance
Enter a movie name and get your next watch!

# Research questions
+ What topics can be recovered using LDA on the movie synopsis?
+ Do these topics reflect the genres? Or labels from the MPST dataset?
+ Are topics enough for movie recommendations?
+ What additional features should we consider?


# Methods
## Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic model that assumes each document contains a mixture of multiple hidden topics. Initially, LDA randomly assigns words to topics, kicking off a learning procedure. It then traverses through each word in each document, applying the complex formula presented in the source. Through numerous iterations of this procedure, it eventually yields a set of topics. Rather than focusing on individual words, LDA identifies themes or topics that underlie the words in a collection of documents. 
It filters out words that are highly repetitive across documents, as they don't contribute to distinguishing the themes.

+ Each topic is a distribution over words
+ Each document is a mixture of corpus wide topics
+ Each word is drawn from one of those topics
