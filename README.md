# Abstract (150 words)
This project explores the connection between movies and real-world events, examining whether films reflect actual real-life events. Art, including cinema, often mirrors real-world circumstances and conveys specific messages or emotions. To investigate this, we analyze movie themes using word embedding techniques, which capture the overall theme of film synopses. Then getting the theme of events we can see if there are correlations between events and movies. 

# Research questions
+ By knowing which movies were inspired by a given event we can analyze what genre is most often used for which kind of event?
+ Given countries may use movies as an expression medium. Have most events that have led to positive or negative outcomes been most inspiring?
