# Abstract (150 words)
Movie recommendation algorithms often use users' viewing histories to suggest similar content through a method known as Content-Based Filtering. Similarity can be defined in many ways, such as genres, shared directors or box-office earnings. This project focuses on using movie synopses to assess similarity, employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for unsupervised clustering. LDA is utilized to uncover hidden themes within movie synopses that extend beyond conventional genres, revealing deeper patterns in movie content. By analyzing these newly discovered themes, we aim to identify unique connections between films, enabling enhanced and diversified movie recommendations.


# Research questions
+ What topics can be recovered using LDA on the movie synopsis?
+ Do these topics reflect the genres? Or labels from the MPST dataset?
+ Are topics enough for movie recommendations?
+ What additional features should we consider?

*Note: If the coherence score is low the rest of the analysis will remain valid using the label from the MPST dataset*

# Proposed additional datasets
MPST: Movie Plot Synopses with Tags: to retrieve movies' synopsis (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cryptexcode/mpst-movie-plot-synopses-with-tags?resource=download)

IMDb ratings: to get movie ratings (https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/)


# Methods
## Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic model that assumes each document contains a mixture of multiple hidden topics. Initially, LDA randomly assigns words to topics, kicking off a learning procedure. It then traverses through each word in each document, applying the complex formula presented in the source. Through numerous iterations of this procedure, it eventually yields a set of topics. Rather than focusing on individual words, LDA identifies themes or topics that underlie the words in a collection of documents. 
It filters out words that are highly repetitive across documents, as they don't contribute to distinguishing the themes.

+ Each topic is a distribution over words
+ Each document is a mixture of corpus wide topics
+ Each word is drawn from one of those topics


The users must decide on the amount of topics present in the document as well as interpret what the topics are.

To assess the quality of the model, we will evaluate its coherence score.

### Coherence score
Coherence measures how well the words grouped in a given topic are related in meaning and whether they frequently co-occur within the same document. A higher coherence score indicates that the words in a topic are semantically related and distinct from other topics, suggesting that the topic grouping is meaningful and accurate.

# Timeline
1. Present different themes obtained with LDA, depending on the number of topics
2. Compare the themes obtained with the labels and the genres
3. Look at the characteristics (country, ratings, box-office) of the themes
4. Look at the temporal evolution of the themes
